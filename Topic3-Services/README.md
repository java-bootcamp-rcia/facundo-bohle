# Shopping Cart API

This API was designed following the (Advices Of Joshua Block)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAb7hSCtvGw] 
and implemented using TDD and code snippets.

# About the Tools I've learnt
- Swagger comes very handy when it comes to specifying APIs features. I highly
recommend to use it. Specially Open API 3.0, which I have not used, but looks 
way simplier and smoothier.

# Impediments
- The concept of "Service" came in really strange to me, but I got used to
it after a few hours reading and learning.

-I was not able to code the controllers and making a detailed spec, due to my
shallow knowledge about HTTP protocols and XML/Json. I'll work on it
