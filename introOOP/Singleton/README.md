Singleton Creational Design Pattern. The DB is just a 
simulation.


### Prerequisites

For this program to run you need to count with:
* JDK 8+

* A Java IDE (To analyze the code)

## Running the tests

I've included a little test called 'DBConnectionTest' which once ran,
will make sure that:
* One unique connection exists.
* The connection is valid.

## Deployment

In order to run the Connection you must Run 'DBConnectionDemo.java' which is the class
that handles the Singleton Pattern built DBConnection class.
